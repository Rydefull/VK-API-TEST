# Android app with vk api
I wanted to create an app with vk music but it can't happen officially. Here is an app where you can login through VK ID and it can load and open pictures from your profile instead. 

To use this app you should create your developer acc on vkontakte, confirm your personality with your passport, create and customize your app's roots.

Inter your account's id in MainActivty.kt and your app's id in strings.xml in res in "com_vk_sdk_AppId"
